## Introduction
The application, **Smart Security**, allow the administrator/users to manage their room security, with motion detection and video recording, the administrator can add unlimited amount of rooms provided there is enough hardware. Each hardware has a RFID card reader, to allow access to room, a temperature sensor to monitor the roomâ€™s temperature, a LED screen to display room name and messages to user, a motion sensor & camera. Administrator can keep track & allow specific card to access certain rooms, the motion sensor will be disarmed if room is currently being accessed. Upon any irregularity such as motion detected , the application will start a video recording and will be recorded down into a file and it will notify the administrator through telegram with the video.

The **admin web interface** will allow the administrator view historial temperature, access history & motion detected recordings. Also, they can manage each room and view access rights requests of users as well as approve/reject them

The **user web interface** will allow users to view live feed of the iot sensor data and, request for a RFID card reader and request for access rights to the rooms for their RFID card reader.
